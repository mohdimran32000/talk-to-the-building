-- Migration 023: chunk identity — stamp every chunk with where it came from.
--
-- WHY: eval/results.jsonl (2026-08-29 tuning split) measured recall@48 = 100% and
-- recall@12 = 100% — the right chunk is always fetched and always survives
-- reranking — but decoy-beaten = 50%. Every retrieval failure was DECOY_ABOVE: a
-- look-alike passage from a DIFFERENT document outranking the correct one. Search
-- is not the problem; discrimination is. This migration is the schema half of the
-- fix — the app half (ingestion.py: identity_header(), title= at embed time) is
-- gated behind retrieval_flags.flag("chunk_identity") and lands in the same PR.
--
-- 🔴 READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING THE TWO RPCs BELOW — signature-stability rule:
-- Migration 022 had to DROP both match_document_chunks_* functions before
-- recreating them, because changing an INPUT parameter's type (vector(768) ->
-- vector(1536)) with a same-named, same-arg-count CREATE OR REPLACE creates an
-- AMBIGUOUS OVERLOAD instead of replacing anything — Postgres resolves a call by
-- (name, input arg types) only, so two functions can silently coexist and every
-- call becomes "function is not unique", or worse, resolves to the wrong one.
--
-- This migration does NOT touch any input parameter — but it DOES change the
-- RETURN shape (RETURNS TABLE gains 7 columns). Postgres's rule for that case is
-- different again: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refuses to change the output-column
-- list of an existing RETURNS TABLE / OUT-parameter function outright (it raises
-- "cannot change return type of existing function", not a silent overload) UNLESS
-- the function is dropped first. Rather than depend on that being a loud error in
-- every Postgres version, we apply the SAME explicit-DROP discipline migration 022
-- used for input types, here for the return type. Get this wrong in either
-- direction — an overload for inputs, or a refused/partial replace for outputs —
-- and hybrid search silently returns nothing, which is exactly how the migration
-- 021 ivfflat bug behaved before anyone noticed.
--
-- SCOPE: only /om-waterheaters and /om-firefighting get re-ingested with the flag
-- on (per the experiment plan) — every other folder's existing rows keep NULL in
-- the 7 new columns until they are re-ingested. NULL is a valid, expected state,
-- not an error: both RPCs below select the columns as plain passthroughs and the
-- app already treats an absent identity as "omit it" (identity_header() itself
-- treats None the same way).
--
-- DATA IMPACT: none. ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS only adds nullable columns; no
-- existing row is rewritten, no embedding is touched, no re-embed is required by
-- this migration alone (chunk_identity's title= change DOES require re-embedding
-- the two target folders, but that is the app-level re-ingest step, not this SQL).

-- ── 1. document_chunks: add the 7 identity columns ──
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- TRANSACTION WRAPPER — added before this was run against the live database.
--
-- This migration DROPs both search RPCs before recreating them. Postgres DDL is
-- transactional, so wrapping the whole file means either every statement lands or
-- none does. Without the wrapper, a failure between the DROP and the CREATE would
-- leave the live system with NO search function at all — and the app's failure
-- mode there is silence, not an error (migration 021's ivfflat bug returned zero
-- rows for weeks without anyone noticing).
--
-- CREATE INDEX (non-CONCURRENTLY) is transaction-safe, so the GIN index below is
-- covered too.

-- ── 5. keyword-index weighting: header must not flatten ts_rank_cd ──
-- The identity header repeats the SAME doc_title/file_name/page substring across
-- every chunk of a document. If it were indexed at the same weight as the body,
-- a query that happens to match header tokens would rank chunks by document
-- membership rather than by content — the opposite of what chunk_identity is for.
-- Postgres weights (highest to lowest) are A=1.0, B=0.4, C=0.2, D=0.1. Every
-- lexeme from a plain to_tsvector() call (no setweight()) is already implicitly
-- weight D, which is what document_chunks_tsv_trigger() has produced since
-- migration 008 — so this is not a downgrade for existing content, it is
-- upgrading the BODY to weight A and leaving a detected header at D.
--
-- Header detection is deliberately NOT a bracket-only regex: content that
-- legitimately starts with a bracketed phrase (e.g. an inline "[Image: ...]"
-- description already present in this corpus) must not be misread as an identity
-- header and demoted. The header's own "·" (U+00B7) separator is the signature we
-- require in addition to the brackets, which our own header always contains and
-- ordinary prose essentially never does. When flag OFF content has no such first
-- line, header_line is NULL and the whole chunk is indexed as body at weight A —
-- a strict superset of the old (uniform D) behaviour, so relative ranking within
-- any single query is unaffected for un-stamped chunks.
