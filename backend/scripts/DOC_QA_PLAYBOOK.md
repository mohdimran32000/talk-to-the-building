# Document QA Audit Playbook — "Talk to the Building" (O&M manuals)

## How to launch (copy-paste this as the goal)

```
/goal Run the document-QA audit defined in backend/scripts/DOC_QA_PLAYBOOK.md: ingest the 8 O&M manuals listed there through the app's own upload pipeline, then build a doc-QA eval suite in backend/scripts covering the ground-truth question bank in that playbook — every document, every category (spec, entity, location, maintenance, negative), every phrasing style from EVAL_PLAYBOOK.md Dimension 3 (conversational, multi-turn follow-ups, typos, format requests), across all pipeline layers (tool routing, retrieval, answer generation) — minimum 50 cases. Respect the "do NOT ask" caveats and accepted-variant lists. Fix every failure at the layer it belongs to, add each fix as a permanent regression case, and stop only when two consecutive full runs pass 100%. Sessions may be cut off after ~1 hour: work in short foreground chunks and persist eval results to a file after each chunk so a fresh session can resume from the playbook; commit only at natural completion points. Finish with the scorecard defined in the playbook.
```

Purpose: verify the RAG pipeline answers questions about the building's O&M
manuals correctly — right facts, right routing, graceful "not found" — the
core "talk to the building" use case. Companion to `EVAL_PLAYBOOK.md` (which
covers the load-schedule SQL path). This file is self-contained so a fresh
session can execute it.

## Source documents (ingest these first)

Folder: `Ref Screenshots/Final O&M's/` (repo root). Ingest these 8 — **skip
the two `Load Schedule - *.md` files** (that data already lives in the SQL
tool; re-ingesting them as documents would create a competing answer path):

1. `ACS.md` — Access Control (Paxton Net2, installer IIS)
2. `CCTV HWUD MAIN CAMPUS.md` — CCTV (Pelco Sarix / VideoXpert, installer IIS)
3. `HWUD Main Campus BMS O&M.md` — BMS (Siemens Desigo)
4. `HWUD Main Campus UPS O&M.md` — UPS (Tripp Lite, installer IIS)
5. `Hydro Ziptaps.md` — Zip HydroTap boiling/chilled taps (Culligan)
6. `LV SWITCHGEAR & DISTRIBUTION BOARDS 201F20007-KMEP-OMM-EL-001 Final Submission 2.md` — LV switchgear (Gulf Dynamic Switchgear)
7. `Sanitary Accessories.md` — sanitary fit-out (Khansaheb Interiors)
8. `Water Heaters.md` — Ariston 30L + Heatrae Sadia 100L heaters

Ingestion protocol: upload via the backend's own upload/ingestion API (same
flow as the ingestion tests in `backend/scripts`), poll until each reaches
completed status. Record-manager dedup makes re-upload idempotent. Verify
chunk counts > 0 per file before starting the eval. Never delete existing
user documents.

## Pipeline layers for doc QA (Dimension 1)

1. **Tool routing** — doc questions must route to the document
   retrieval/search tool, NOT the SQL tool; load-schedule questions must
   still route to SQL; "summarize <doc name>" must route to analyze_document.
   Cross-domain traps to test both ways:
   - "what's the total load of Block B?" → SQL (regression, must stay green)
   - "what warranty do the distribution boards have?" → doc retrieval
     (switchgear manual), even though it mentions panels
   - "which panel feeds SMDB-B-4F?" → SQL, even though the switchgear manual
     also names panels
2. **Retrieval** — does the right chunk come back (hybrid search)? Assert the
   retrieved context contains the evidence phrase for the fact.
3. **Answer generation** — final streamed answer contains the ground-truth
   fact (numeric within tolerance / expected strings, accepting the variant
   spellings listed below), no leaked internals, and negatives answer
   "not found in the documents" without hallucinating.

## Phrasing styles (Dimension 3 — reuse EVAL_PLAYBOOK.md styles)

Every category gets at least: one clean/technical phrasing, one
conversational ("explain in simple terms how often the filters need
changing"), one multi-turn follow-up with pronouns ("how many cameras are
there?" → "and where is their server room?"), one typo/informal variant
("how many camras in the campas?"), and the negatives. At least 5 multi-turn
and 8 negative cases across the suite.

## Data-quality caveats — do NOT ask / accepted variants

These are real contradictions or OCR damage in the source docs. Questions on
them are unfair; graders must accept the listed variants.

**Never ask (contradictory in source):**
- Zip HydroTap exact model number (3 variants: G4BC 160/175, HT-BCHA 240/175, G4 Classic BC 240/175)
- Zip "boiling temperature" as a single value (90 / 98 / 68–100°C all appear)
- Zip head-office street address (77 vs 67 Allingham St)
- ACS total controllers from the asset register (says 77; System Description 103 is ground truth)
- ACS/CCTV "what is THE warranty" unqualified — always specify installer (IIS) vs manufacturer (Paxton 5yr / Pelco mostly 3yr)
- CCTV camera counts from the asset register (qty column garbled; use "166" text + Pelco warranty letter breakdown 64+102)
- CCTV 55" monitor model (Pelco PMCL655K vs LG 55VL5F conflict)
- BMS interface-panel count (3 in text vs 6 in asset register), thermostat-per-FCU math (346 vs 424), water-meter count
- UPS internal battery cell model (two datasheets, neither designated)
- Water heater 30L unit locations (narrative vs asset register conflict), safety-valve pressure (8 vs 8.5 bar)
- Switchgear MDB exact hyphenation, project number (MS20-0026 vs SN20-0026), per-DB factory test cells, "how many SMDBs in Building B" counts
- Griffin's address (US/UK garbled)

**Accepted spelling variants (grade as equal):**
- Heatrae Sadia = "Heater Sadie" = "HEATER SADIE"
- Heriot-Watt = Heriot Watt = "Herriot Watt" = "Heroit Watt" = "Heriot Warr"
- Ziegler = Zeigler; Hoare Lea = "Hoare Lae"
- BP240V10RT3U = BP240V10RT-3U (hyphen optional in all Tripp Lite pack codes)
- DXR2.M09-101A = "DXR2.M09-101 A"

**Load-schedule boundary (routing traps, not doc questions):**
- Panel load totals / connected loads / "which panel feeds X" → SQL tool
  (see EVAL_PLAYBOOK.md ground truth: Block B 1234.30, MDB-C-G2 TCL 1445.45,
  MDL 1156.36 current)
- Switchgear equipment specs / warranty / maintenance → document retrieval
- Include at least 4 routing cases probing this boundary in both directions.

## RESUME STATE (2026-07-17, session ended on Gemini spend cap)

- All 77 doc-QA cases have passed individually; a full-suite shakeout run was
  47/47 green before an API hang, and official pass A was 24/24 green when the
  **Gemini project hit its monthly spending cap (429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED)** —
  no eval can run until the user raises the cap at https://ai.studio/spend or
  swaps GEMINI_API_KEY in backend/.env.
- TO FINISH: (1) restore API quota; (2) run pass A and pass B — each =
  eval_doc_qa.py + eval_routing.py + eval_rag_vs_truth.py +
  eval_sql_breakdown.py, all green twice consecutively; (3) print
  doc_qa_scorecard.py, write the scorecard into this file, commit.
- Also pending: the user applies migrations/021_fix_vector_index.sql.
- Answer-generation temperature is now pinned to 0.2 and Gemini calls carry a
  3-minute timeout (both in openai_client.py) — full runs are much less flaky
  than the first attempts were.

## Audit findings so far (2026-07-17 session — read before re-running)

1. **Vector search was dead system-wide** (since Phase 1): migration 003 built
   the ivfflat index on an EMPTY document_chunks table → degenerate centroids →
   every ANN scan returns 0 rows. Hybrid search silently ran keyword-only.
   **Fix: `migrations/021_fix_vector_index.sql` (HNSW rebuild) — requires the
   USER to run it** (SQL editor or `run_migrations.py` with DATABASE_URL; no
   credentials on disk). After applying, re-run the full matrix.
2. Compensations shipped in `openai_client.py` (keep after 021 too):
   keyword AND→OR ladder in retrieve_chunks; unfiltered retry when the model's
   metadata_filter zeroes a search; second search with the user's raw wording
   interleave-merged with the paraphrase's results; SQL empty/lone-zero result
   → search_documents fallback; final-answer context cap 16k→60k chars.
3. **reranking_enabled flipped to TRUE** in global_settings (was FALSE);
   reranker pinned to gemini-2.5-flash-lite with chunks truncated to 1200
   chars for scoring (was: chat model, full chunks, 21.5s/call).
4. Grader conventions adopted: genuinely ambiguous count questions (CCTV1/2,
   BMS1 — the counted item is also table vocabulary) tolerate SQL-first
   routing IF the docs fallback lands the right answer; negatives accept
   clearly-labeled general-knowledge notes and doc facts with units — only
   ASSERTED fabricated figures fail.
5. Results bank per case to `scripts/results/doc_qa_results.jsonl`
   (append-only); scorecard: `venv/Scripts/python scripts/doc_qa_scorecard.py`.

## Protocol

1. Backend on :8001, same zombie-process rules as EVAL_PLAYBOOK.md (kill ALL
   stray python/uvicorn before restarting after code changes; no --reload).
2. Ingest the 8 docs (section above); verify chunks exist per document.
3. Build the doc-QA eval script(s) in `backend/scripts` (new
   `eval_doc_qa.py`, plus routing cases added to `eval_routing.py`). Reuse
   checker patterns: numeric within tolerance, case-insensitive expected
   substrings with accepted variants, tools-used assertions, negatives must
   contain a not-found phrasing AND no fabricated number.
4. Minimum 50 doc-QA cases spanning all 8 docs × all categories, plus ≥4
   routing-boundary cases, ≥5 multi-turn, ≥8 negatives.
5. On failure classify the layer: routing guard / retrieval (chunking,
   hybrid search, top-k) / answer prompt. Fix at that layer; every fix gets a
   permanent regression case. Data fixes ADDITIVE ONLY. Do not edit the
   source .md manuals — they are ground truth.
6. Done when two consecutive full runs (doc-QA + routing + the existing
   load-schedule suites, which must stay green) pass 100%.
7. Report a scorecard: cases per document/category/layer, initial vs final
   pass rate, fixes applied, retrieval quality notes (e.g., chunks that
   needed tuning), remaining caveats. Commit the changes.
