"""
Goal-driven eval: RAG SQL-tool answers vs independently computed ground truth.

For each question, ground truth is computed by HAND-WRITTEN SQL (authored and
verified separately from the LLM pipeline) over the same structured_data
tables, loaded into DuckDB exactly the way sql_tool loads them. The question
is then run through the real execute_sql_query pipeline and the two are
compared:
  - kind="number": the truth value must appear among the numeric cells of the
    RAG result's markdown table (tolerance 0.01)
  - kind="text":   every expected string must appear in the RAG result

Case kinds:
  - kind="number":     truth value must appear among the numeric cells (tol 0.01)
  - kind="number_any": at least ONE of the values in "accept" must appear —
                       for genuinely ambiguous questions with two valid framings
  - kind="text":       every expected string must appear in the RAG result
  - kind="negative":   the entity/filter doesn't exist — result must be empty,
                       NULL or zero; any nonzero numeric cell is a hallucination

This is the automated alternative to manually testing questions in the UI.
Add new cases as bad answers are discovered — each becomes a regression test.
