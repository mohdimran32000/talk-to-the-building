# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-01)

**Core value:** The agent can locate the *right* piece of information in a large, organized knowledge base — using semantic search when meaning matters and codebase-style traversal (tree/glob/grep/read) when precision matters — without hallucinating across unrelated material.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Schema Foundation + Two-Scope RLS + Path Normalizer

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Schema Foundation + Two-Scope RLS + Path Normalizer)
Plan: 1 of 8 in current phase (Wave 1 complete — normalize_path helper)
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-05-03 -- Plan 01-01 (normalize_path helper) complete

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 13%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: ~1 min
- Total execution time: ~1 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1 | ~1 min | ~1 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (~1 min, 1 file, 1 task)
- Trend: ✅ on-spec, no deviations, paste-from-RESEARCH succeeded first try

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Path-based folder model (`folder_path TEXT` + thin `folders` side table) chosen over `ltree` — folder-name charset (hyphens, dots, spaces) and LLM ergonomics
- Phase 1: `documents.content_markdown` stored alongside chunks rather than reconstructed on demand — chunk overlap would corrupt grep line numbers
- Phase 1: Two-scope model (`user` + `global`) with admin-only writes; tools default `scope='both'` with override arg
- Phase 1: Five small migrations (012–016) over one mega-migration — individually reviewable + revertable
- Phase 1 / Plan 01: `normalize_path()` uses stdlib only (`re`, `unicodedata`); raises `ValueError` (not custom exception) for invalid input; NFC Unicode normalization; case preserved (Postgres comparison is case-sensitive — `/Projects` ≠ `/projects` is intentional)
- Phase 1 / Plan 01: Inline `__main__` self-tests (15 cases) — fast sanity check; full matrix lives in plan 08's `test_two_scope_rls.py`
- Phase 2: Backfill re-runs Docling against original Storage blobs (NOT chunk stitching); blobs that are GC'd → `requires_user_reupload`
- Phase 5: SSE sub-agent event protocol generalized at the second sub-agent (Explorer), not bolted on
- Phase 6: Drag-drop uses native HTML5 (no `react-arborist` / `dnd-kit` / `react-dnd`)

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- **Rank-1 pitfall to design out in Phase 1: two-scope RLS scope-leak.** Separate INSERT/UPDATE policies per scope, `WITH CHECK (scope = OLD.scope)` forbidding scope mutation, CHECK constraint coupling scope/user_id. Gate Phase 2 on `test_two_scope_rls.py` cross-user × cross-scope matrix passing 100%.
- Phase 2 operational risk: Storage retention for original blobs (some Episode 1 blobs may be GC'd) — `requires_user_reupload` fallback is non-negotiable.
- Open question for Phase 4 planning: token budget defaults for `tree`/`grep` and `read_document.limit`; whether `scope` is explicit arg vs. implicit-from-folder_path (likely both, with explicit winning).
- Open question for Phase 5 planning: token budget for Explorer's compact summary output.
